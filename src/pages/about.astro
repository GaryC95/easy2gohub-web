    <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
      Easy2GoHub is a collection of simple, fast, and privacy-first tools designed to help you get everyday tasks done
      directly in your browser.
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
      Our tools focus on common needs such as image processing, PDF handling, text formatting, and developer utilities.
      Whenever possible, processing happens locally on your device — meaning your files are not uploaded to our servers.
    </p>

    <p class="text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
      We believe useful tools should be accessible, transparent, and respectful of user privacy. Easy2GoHub is built with
      modern web technologies and is continuously improved based on real-world usage.
    </p>
